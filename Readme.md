## It's very simple to use this script.
Run:
`$ make DoS `
or: 
`$ gcc DoS.c -o DoS

It's usefully for compilate your code and can run it.

First, you'll need two arguments:
1. The IP adress
2. The open port
and execute:
`$ ./DoS <ip> <port>`
if you don't use this arguments this message will appear:
``[!] Error by -> too few args!

So, after you executed this script the DoS will work.
if you get a bug in my code, comment in "Issues" from my repository.
